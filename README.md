# Hello, I'm Gabriel Oliveira! 👋🏻

### About Me

🚀 Production Engineer | Data Analyst | Business Intelligence | Supply Chain Consultant | SAP IBP Specialist

🎓 I hold a degree in Production Engineering and I have an MBA in Data Analysis from USP/ESALQ.


📊 I currently work as a mid-level Data Analyst in the market intelligence sector. I've always had a passion for the data field, combining my consulting experience with a solid background in analysis. I am particularly interested in transforming data into strategic decisions, with a focus on business, operations, and technology.


💼 I worked for 3.5 years as a Supply Chain consultant at EY, focusing on technology solutions. As an SAP IBP specialist, I was involved in implementation and maintenance projects for both SAP IBP and SAP APO. During this time, I participated in projects related to Demand Planning, S&OP, and Control Tower, in addition to initiatives focused on data quality, process improvement, and data governance.

🎹 In my free time, I like to doing personal projects, reading and playing the piano, which I mostly love.
